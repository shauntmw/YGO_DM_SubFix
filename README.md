# Overview
This repo are the subtitle fix for [[F-R] Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters (Japanese, English Sub)](https://nyaa.si/view/1399167) .

There are many subtitle out-of-sync issues, so I have tried my best to fix the subtitle files for them.

# Special notes
**Episode 25** - There is an audio de-sync issue. Use mkvtoolnix to add 500ms delay into the audio, and remux it.

**Episode 125** - The video file is corrupted. I have reused the subtitle file, re-adjusted it to fit with the video from [[MSRT]Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters-Episode 001-224 The End+[Movie]](https://nyaa.si/view/569930).

# FAQ
**How to watch with the fixed subtitles?**

On PC, put the subtitle file into the same folder of the video file. When launching the video, change to use the new subtitle file.

On other video devices, you will probably need to re-mux the video file to include the subtitle file. I use mkvtoolnix for it.
